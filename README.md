A tool to allow configuration and operating of OpenInverter systems for
electric vehicles over a CAN connection.

## Features

* Display all available modifiable parameters and read-only values supported by a given inverter firmware version
* Read a specified parameter/value
* Write a new value to a specified parameter
* Display the current value of each parameter/value on a given device
* Log a list of parameters to a CSV file at regular intervals
* Save and load all parameters to and from a JSON file
* Manage parameter to custom [CAN message mappings](https://github.com/davefiddes/openinverter-can-tool/blob/main/docs/can-mapping.md):
  * Create, remove and list parameter mappings on a device
  * Support maps with standard CAN 2.0a and extended CAN 2.0b frames
  * Export and import mappings to a local JSON file
  * Export mappings to DBC allowing easier debugging with [SavvyCAN](https://savvycan.com/)
* Upgrade firmware or recover devices over CAN
* Display the inverter serial number
* Command the inverter to:
  * Start
  * Stop
  * Load parameters from flash
  * Save parameters to flash
  * Revert parameters to their default values
  * Reset
* Scan a CAN bus for possible nodes
* Runs on Linux, Windows and MacOS with python 3.9+
* Support [shell completion](https://github.com/davefiddes/openinverter-can-tool/blob/main/docs/shell-completion.md) for commands and options for bash, zsh and fish shells
* Works with any CAN adapter supported by [python-can](https://pypi.org/project/python-can/)
* Supports [stm32-sine](https://github.com/jsphuebner/stm32-sine) 5.24.R or later
* Automatic parameter database download and caching (requires stm32-sine 5.27.R or later)
* Works with [Foccci/Clara](https://github.com/uhi22/ccs32clara) CCS controller and [Stm32-vcu](https://github.com/damienmaguire/Stm32-vcu) (a.k.a. Zombieverter VCU)

## Installation

To avoid any clashes with other software the tool is best is best installed using the [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/) package manager. Install this following the [pipx installation guide](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) for your platform.

### Initial Install

The most recent release may be installed using:

```text
    pipx install openinverter_can_tool
```

### Upgrading

Upgrading to the most recent release is carried out using pip:

```text
    pipx upgrade openinverter_can_tool
```

## Configuration

Before the tool can be used the CAN interface adapter needs to be configured. To do this create `~/.canrc` on Linux and MacOS or `%USERPROFILE%/can.conf` on Windows. Details on interfaces supported and the configuration file format can be found in the [python-can](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html) documentation.

An example configuration file for a [SocketCAN](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interfaces/socketcan.html) compatible adapter on Linux would look like:

```text
[default]
interface = socketcan
channel = can0
bitrate = 500000
```

Note: Before the tool can on Linux run the SocketCAN network interface needs to be started:

```text
    sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000
```

An example configuration file for a [SLCAN](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interfaces/slcan.html) adapter such as [GVRET](https://github.com/collin80/GVRET) on Windows would look like:

```text
[default]
interface = slcan
channel = COM8
bitrate = 500000
```

### Tested interfaces

* [Innomaker USB2CAN](https://www.inno-maker.com/product/usb2can-cable/) CAN interface in Linux using `socketcan`
* [GVRET](https://github.com/collin80/GVRET) CAN interface using `slcan` in Linux
* [MKS CANable V2.0 Pro](https://github.com/makerbase-mks/CANable-MKS) using `slcan` in Windows and Linux
* [FYSETC UCAN](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/267167770235) using `slcan` in MacOS

Let me know if you have used a particular CAN interface successfully and I can expand this list.

The many CANable clone devices on eBay or AliExpress can be swapped from `socketcan` to `slcan` firmware (or vice versa) using the [web firmware updater](https://canable.io/updater/canable1.html).

### Incompatible interfaces

These python-can drivers are known to have problems with openinverter_can_tool:

* [Geschwister Schneider and candleLight](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interfaces/gs_usb.html) using `gs_usb` on Windows or Linux. This prevents Innomaker USB2CAN from working with Windows.

## Command Line Usage

To get the usage information for the tool run the `oic` command with no parameters:

```text
    Usage: oic [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    OpenInverter CAN Tool allows querying and setting configuration of inverter
    parameters over a CAN connection

    Options:
    -d, --database FILE       Override the OpenInverter JSON parameter database
                                to use
    -c, --context TEXT        Which python-can configuration context to use
    -n, --node INTEGER RANGE  The CAN SDO node ID to communicate with  [env var:
                                OIC_NODE; default: 1; 1<=x<=127]
    -t, --timeout FLOAT       Response timeout in seconds  [default: 1.0]
    --debug                   Enable detailed debugging messages

To scan for OpenInverter devices on a CAN network:

```text
    $ oic scan
    Scanning for devices. Please wait...

    Found possible OpenInverter node: 1
    Found possible OpenInverter node: 3
```

To read the current value of a parameter:

```text
    $ oic read brakeregen
    brakeregen          : -50
```

Values may be changed using symbolic names:

```text
    oic write potmode DualChannel

## Experimental GUI

An experimental GUI version of the tool exists which can be started by running the `oic-gui` command:
